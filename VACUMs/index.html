	<p>Since starting my recent job as a computer science professor at Brown University, I have tracked every step I've taken, every minute of my time, every cent I've spent, and every task completed for my work. This has taught me some things about myself including: 1) how much time I spend working and what proportions of my time is spent on teaching, grants, papers, experiments, etc., 2) when I go to sleep and when I wake up, and 3) how much time I spend in the office, at home, and elsewhere. This page presents some aggregate charts and summary statistics of a subset of the self-tracking data I have since August 1, 2013, and is automatically updated daily; I plan to eventually release all my data and code.</p>
	<p>This chart shows where I am at different times of the day for the past couple months, tracked through my phone. The long purple columns are the long weekend I was out of town during Labor Day weekend. You can tell from this chart I am a late riser, usually getting to work around 11am for my class, and leave somewhere around 6pm. My schedule changes fairly often but it looks like I'm very likely to be in the office on weekdays from 2-4pm. I'm in the office a lot more since Labor Day weekend because classes are in session.</p>
	<p>If you mouseover the image, you can see my sleep and work schedule overlaid on the location information. White shaded areas are when I'm sleeping, and dark shaded areas are when I'm working.</p>
	<div class="locations"></div>
	<p>To clearly define my work, I categorize my job into 10 separate activities:
	<ol>
	<li>Teaching includes actual time in the classroom, course preparation, and course related meetings with my co-instructor and teaching assistants.</li>
	<li>Experiments is time spent doing the actual research work, which includes writing code (including building this page), collecting data, analyses, user studies, and so forth. Time spent on self-tracking is counted in 'experiments'.</li>
	<li>Planning involves thinking and writing about my overall research agenda, planning projects, and setting daily goals.
	<li>Socializing includes meeting with students, faculty, reporters, etc., as well as attending conferences.</li>
	<li>Learning is self-directed learning I do for enrichment that includes reading papers and books not directly relevant to a specific project, or attending talks.</li>
	<li>Grants are fairly self-explanatory, and this category includes time spent writing grant proposals, attending grant workshops, or performing obligations to satisfy the terms of an awarded grant.</li>
	<li>Papers is the process of outlining, reviewing related work, and writing the actual papers that are prepared for publication.</li>
	<li>Email is any time I spend in my email client reading and responding to emails; however, sometimes if I am preparing an email specific to another category here I will not tag this time as 'email', such as if I am writing a lengthy message to explain a grant proposal to a collaborator.</li>
	<li>Service comprises departmental service such as serving on committees like this year's PhD admissions committee or students' reading committees, and external service like reviewing papers, organizing conferences, and writing reference letters.</li>
	<li>Administrative are things I do that are necessary for me to do the rest of my job; this is a bit of a catch all, but I think of it as things that don't count. This category can include tasks like paperwork, arranging travel for myself or visitors, purchasing and setting up equipment, or maintaining my homepage or CV.</li>
	</ol></p>
	<p>This next pair of charts tracks the type of work I do, aggregated by week and by day. The daily one below is a bit harder to read because of the daily variation. As of this writing, I work around 42 hours a week and so far, two-thirds of my time has been spent on email, teaching, experiments, and socializing. I hope to be able to reduce the time spent on email in the future, but it's likely I will be receiving more email as my time at Brown continues. Service is currently minimal, but is also likely to increase over time. I like that I spend a lot of time teaching and socializing, as I feel those are good uses of my time. I do want to increase how much learning I do and will be scheduling more time for that.</p>
